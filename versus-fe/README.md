# Versus <small><i>- connecting casual atheletes</i> </small>

## The Idea

Versus is a mobile platform to connect casual athletes by the sports they love to play.

Key features include joining leagues for various 1vs1 sports, participating in a city-wide ranking, and challenging others within those leagues. It also features performance visualisation so you can see your progress over time.

## Motivation

Finding people to play sports with casually can be hard, and to find people who are your level can be even harder. This is where Versus comes in.

Versus ranks all the players using the sophisticated Elo rating system from chess. This allows you to quickly and easily match people of your level, and upon winning or losing, gain a higher or lower score based on your opponent.

The app can record your performance to see you game improve over time, providing a gamification effect, constantly challenging yourself to be better.
